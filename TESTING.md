# LUXSTICKER AI — Test Plan (updated Phase 1.2)

Manual test plan covering **Phase 1.2 — Final Quality Gate + Build
Versioning**. Run these in a real browser (`npm run dev`) — background
removal (WASM model) and Google Fonts both need real internet access, which
this sandbox's build environment does not have. Where noted, the underlying
*algorithm* was verified numerically instead of end-to-end in a browser (see
"Sandbox-verified" column).

Profile under test: `LINE_STICKER` — ≤370×320px, even dimensions, ≤1MB PNG,
transparent, ≥10px padding around content, no background leak.

| # | Case | Steps | Expected | Sandbox-verified |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 01 | Person + plain background | Upload a person photo with a simple/flat background | All 8 validation checks pass → ✓ READY TO USE | Pipeline/type-check only — the actual AI cutout needs a browser |
| 02 | Photo has a real background | Upload a photo with a busy background | Background removed by `@imgly/background-removal`; `background-removal` check passes | Needs a browser (WASM model fetch) |
| 03 | Background removal failure | Force `isFallbackCutout: true` | `background-removal` check fails → `validation.passed=false` → Download disabled → dedicated "⚠️ BACKGROUND REMOVAL FAILED" card with Try Again / Upload Another Image, **never** auto-fixed | **Yes** — confirmed by code path: `AUTO_FIXABLE_CHECK_IDS` in `export-normalizer` excludes `background-removal`; `ExportStatusCard` special-cases `isFallbackCutout` before the generic ready/not-ready branches |
| 04 | Content touching the edge | Compose so content sits close to the canvas edge | `cropAndFitToBounds` always re-centers content with a full `paddingPx` margin computed in *output* space (not scaled with content), so this self-corrects; the `padding` check's auto-fix (nudge `paddingPx` up, re-crop) is the backstop | **Yes** — see crop-math verification below |
| 05 | Dimension 371×321 (just over budget) | Content bbox that would naturally exceed 370×320 | `cropAndFitToBounds` computes one uniform scale factor so content+padding fits inside 370×320 — never stretches, aspect ratio preserved | **Yes** — numerically verified (see below): a 500×250 content box → scaled to 344×172 inside a 370×198 canvas, aspect ratio 2.0000 → 2.0000 exactly unchanged |
| 06 | Odd final dimension | Any content whose padded size rounds to an odd width/height | `toEvenClamp` rounds to the nearest even number (rounding down instead of up if that would exceed the profile max); `even-dimensions` is now its **own** validation check, separate from `dimensions` | **Yes** — all 5 geometry test cases below land on even width/height, e.g. 300×300 content → final 320×320 |
| 07 | File > 1 MB | Force a large/noisy composited canvas | `normalizeForProfile`'s auto-fix loop shrinks the canvas (×0.88 per attempt, up to 4 attempts) until `file-size` passes, or reports NOT READY with the reason listed if it can't | Retry-loop logic verified by type-check + code review; exact KB numbers need a browser |
| 08 | Long text | Enter a long custom sentence | Composition engine's shrink-until-clear loop prevents clipping; `content-clipping` check still passes | Unchanged from Phase 1.1, re-verified by type-check |
| 09 | Many decorations | Generate with a style that adds several decorations | Decoration engine's bounding-box collision avoidance prevents overlap with text/character; nothing pushed outside the working canvas | Unchanged decoration-engine logic, re-verified by type-check |
| 10 | Transparent background (baseline) | Any successful generation | `detectBackgroundLeak` finds no opaque pixel at any of the 4 corners, along any of the 4 edges, or anywhere outside the content bounding box | **Yes** — see leak-detection verification below |

## New in Phase 1.2: `getStickerContentBounds` + `detectBackgroundLeak`

**Single source of truth (spec §11).** `lib/content-bounds.ts` exports
`getStickerContentBounds(canvas)`, a thin wrapper around the shared
alpha-threshold constant (`CONTENT_ALPHA_THRESHOLD = 8`). `crop-engine`
(both `autoCropCanvas` and `cropAndFitToBounds`), `composition-engine`, and
`validation-engine`'s padding/leak checks all call this one function now,
instead of each calling `alphaBoundingBox` with their own threshold.

**Rigorous transparency check (spec §8/§9).** Re-implemented
`detectBackgroundLeak`'s exact algorithm as a standalone Node script
(`/tmp/verify-leak-detect.mjs` in this session) against a synthetic pixel
buffer, with no real Canvas needed:

```
PASS Clean: fully transparent padding -> hasLeak=false
PASS Leak at top-left corner -> hasLeak=true
PASS Leak on right edge (not a corner) -> hasLeak=true
PASS Leak just outside content box, away from any edge/corner -> hasLeak=true
```

The 4th case is the important one — a naive "check the 4 corners and edges
only" implementation would have missed it, since the leaked pixel touches
neither a corner nor an edge. The full outside-content-box scan catches it.

## Crop/scale geometry verification (carried over from Phase 1.1, re-checked)

Re-implemented `cropAndFitToBounds` + `toEvenClamp`'s exact math as a
standalone Node script (`/tmp/verify-crop-math.mjs`) against 5 scenarios —
all preserve aspect ratio exactly, land within 370×320, produce even
dimensions, and keep ≥10px padding:

```
PASS 1:1 square 300x300            -> final 320x320, aspect 1.0000 -> 1.0000
PASS Wide 500x250 (spec example)   -> final 370x198, aspect 2.0000 -> 2.0000
PASS Small content 120x80          -> final 146x106, aspect 1.5000 -> 1.5000
PASS Huge 2000x2000                -> final 320x320, aspect 1.0000 -> 1.0000
PASS Tall 200x600                  -> final 124x320, aspect 0.3333 -> 0.3333
```

## What was verified in this sandbox

1. `npm run lint` (ESLint) — clean.
2. `npm run build` (Next.js production build, Turbopack) — clean.
3. `tsc --noEmit` — clean.
4. Crop/fit geometry and leak-detection algorithms re-implemented and run
   standalone in Node (above) — all pass.
5. Manual code-path trace: background-removal failures and pre-crop content
   clipping are excluded from the auto-fix retry loop; a real background
   leak is never silently "fixed" either — it's a data-quality problem, not
   a geometry one, so it always surfaces as NOT READY.

## What still needs a real browser

- Actual AI background removal quality (`@imgly/background-removal` fetches
  its ONNX model from a CDN at runtime — blocked by this sandbox's network
  allowlist, works normally for end users).
- Visual confirmation of the editor's drag/resize/rotate/zoom interactions
  (unchanged this phase).
- Real PNG byte sizes for the file-size auto-fix loop (test case 07).
- End-to-end confirmation that `detectBackgroundLeak` correctly flags a
  *real* imperfect AI cutout (haze/halo around hair, etc.), as opposed to
  the synthetic pixel buffer used above.
